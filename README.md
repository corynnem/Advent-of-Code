# Advent-of-Code

## Getting started

To start a new year, copy & paste the `getting-started` folder, which has the file structure for one day
& the file loader. `cd` into the file loader & run `npm i` to install express for the backend & `npm start` to get it started. From there open the live server on the day's html file & you're good to start on day 1! There's a test endpoint to debug any issues with the server, so if you have any issue just change the endpoint on the fetch.

To load in the extremely large text files for this project I just use a simple express server that pulls the puzzle input from the data.txt file in each day's folder. Make sure to add the puzzle input data to the data.txt file before getting started

The previous years solutions are on here so if you want to see them just follow the steps above in each previous year. I just use plain html & js so I can see the output in a browser (terminals feel so small for this amount of data), so if you open the live server on each html file you can see previous solutions etc etc
